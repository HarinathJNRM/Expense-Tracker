 Expense-Tracker
The Expense Tracker is a web-based personal finance management application that I developed to help users track their income, expenses, and overall financial balance.

 Project Overview
The Expense Tracker is a web-based personal finance management application that I developed to help users track their income, expenses, and overall financial balance. 
The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily add, edit, and delete transactions, as well as view summary information about 
their financial status.

 Key Features
- **Transaction Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete transactions, with real-time updates to the summary cards and transaction table.
- **Financial Tracking**: The application provides a comprehensive overview of the user's income, expenses, and current balance, helping them better understand 
their spending habits.
- **Data Persistence**: The Expense Tracker uses the browser's local storage API to persist transaction data, ensuring that users can access their financial history 
even after closing the app.

 Technologies Used
The Expense Tracker was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Used to define the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Used to style the visual appearance of the application, including the header, input form, cards, and transaction table.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented the interactive functionality of the application, such as adding and deleting transactions, updating the summary cards, and saving/loading 
data from local storage.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized the Bootstrap CSS framework to provide a responsive and mobile-friendly design.
- **Local Storage API**: Used the browser's local storage API to persist transaction data, allowing users to access their financial history even after closing the app.

 Development Process
The development of the Expense Tracker involved the following steps:

1. **Planning and Design**: I started by planning the overall structure and functionality of the application, as well as designing the user interface.
2. **Implementation**: I then implemented the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the Bootstrap framework and local storage API to achieve the 
desired features and functionality.
3. **Testing and Debugging**: Throughout the development process, I conducted thorough testing to identify and fix any issues or bugs in the application.
4. **Deployment**: Finally, I deployed the Expense Tracker to a hosting platform, making it accessible to users.

 Outcome and Impact
The Expense Tracker has been well-received by users, who have found it to be a valuable tool for managing their personal finances. The application's clean design, 
robust functionality, and data persistence features have made it a popular choice for individuals looking to better understand and control their spending habits.

Overall, the Expense Tracker project has been a valuable learning experience for me, allowing me to develop my skills in web development, user interface design, 
and project management.
